This project strives to provide solutions for finding distinctions between nouns and verbs when provided EGG data. 
By Baichuan Guo, Wen Jian, and Ruixu Huang.


Datasets used:

Adult_NV800.csv : the original dataset that contains EGG brain signals. 

New_X : dataset after preprosessing, used for pca and cnn, by RH

New_Y : dataset after preprosessing, used for pca and cnn, by RH

New_X4000 : dataset after preprosessing for initial mlp attempt, by RH

New_Y4000 : dataset after preprosessing for initial mlp attempt, by RH

Adult_NV800_avg.csv : dataset after preprosessing for svm/rnn, by BG


Codes that needs to be run:

RH:MLP+PCA : contains codes for initial mlp attempt and pca, by Ruixu Huang

RH:CNN : contains codes for cnn, by Ruixu Huang

WJ_MLP_AllData_Stats : contains codes for mlp and statistical analysis, by Wen Jian

Baichuan_svm : contains codes for svm, by Baichuan Guo

Baichuan_RNN : contains codes for rnn, by Baichuan Guo
